firstly we input LikeReviews.txt
Map:<key1,value1>-->List<key2,value 2>
key1 and value 1 are original input file.key is LongWritable and value is Text.
In the map function, I just need to get the first word in every line. so key2=customer id,  and value2 is one.

List<key2,value2>--><key 3,value 3>
key 3=customers id   type:Text
value 3=sum of reviews liked.
